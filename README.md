# CodeClause_Project1_FaceDetection
A computer vision project called "Face Detection" in Python makes use of the OpenCV package to detect people's faces in digital image and real-time video using the machine learning-based methods to train a face detector model. The project involves capturing pictures or video, then using a face detection algorithm to detect faces in the data.
